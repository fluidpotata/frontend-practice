# Random
A bunch of random tools here :))

## USIS
A set of tools which fetched data from USIS (University Student Information System at BRAC University).  A backend server was used to fetch the data since it needed authentication. Server used to be restricted during registration period and students needed a source to find seat and section status. Thus this tool was born. Not maintained anymore since BRACU introduced new system Connect which is doing its job properly.

## Routine
Tried to make a routine generator, did not finish :)

## Deadline
A personal deadline manager, currently abandoned since no backend and needed to manually edit the json file which was a PIA :))

## Lab
A tool that would show the free labs at a certain time and date. This might have been the most useful tool I made since someone randomly sugeested this to me without knowing who made it :3

## Task Scheduler
A task scheduler I made which only uses browser storage, might add a backend and db to make it useful idk
